# Vue JSON Search

Simple search component based on [Fuse.js](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse). Designed for [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) but works as well with any tool.

- Easy to setup with any software that can output a JSON search corpus
- Ships without styles, easy to style with Tailwind
- Minimal dependencies (Fuse.js and Vue 3)

[Live demo available](https://til.unessa.net/) at til.unessa.net
